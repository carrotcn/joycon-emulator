## JoyCon Emulator

This program takes input from serial port and perform corresponding button and joystick actions on Nintendo Switch, by emulating a controller on a Teensy++ v2.0. It enables automation with external program that sends a pre-defined list of commands through serial port.

#### How to use

*TODO*

This repository has been tested using a Teensy 2.0++.

#### Compiling and Flashing onto the Teensy 2.0++
Go to the Teensy website and download/install the [Teensy Loader application](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html). For Linux, follow their instructions for installing the [GCC Compiler and Tools](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/gcc.html). For Windows, you will need the [latest AVR toolchain](http://www.atmel.com/tools/atmelavrtoolchainforwindows.aspx) from the Atmel site. See [this issue](https://github.com/LightningStalker/Splatmeme-Printer/issues/10) and [this thread](http://gbatemp.net/threads/how-to-use-shinyquagsires-splatoon-2-post-printer.479497/) on GBAtemp for more information. (Note for Mac users - the AVR MacPack is now called AVR CrossPack. If that does not work, you can try installing `avr-gcc` with `brew`.)

LUFA has been included as a git submodule, so cloning the repo like this:

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com: *TODO* .git
```

will put LUFA in the right directory.

Now you should be ready to rock. Open a terminal window in the `joycon-emulator` directory, type `make`, and hit enter to compile. If all goes well, the printout in the terminal will let you know it finished the build! Follow the directions on flashing `Joystick.hex` onto your Teensy, which can be found page where you downloaded the Teensy Loader application.
